agent_1: That my grandmother has been dead for 5 years.
agent_2: How strange, do you believe in ghosts?

agent_1: Well, I would be interested if she could help me.
agent_2: She is the best psychic in town, she has already helped many people to talk to the dead.
agent_1: How much does she charge?
agent_2: 100 euros per session.
agent_1: Yes, let her know and have her come to my house as soon as possible.
agent_2: I need some information to give her. What is your grandmother's name and what did she do for a living?
agent_1: Her name was Carmen and she was a farmer.
agent_2: And what did she die of?
agent_1: She was run over by my grandfather with the tractor, my grandfather's eyesight was failing a little.
agent_2: What a shame. Well, I'll talk to my aunt and we'll solve this problem as soon as possible.
