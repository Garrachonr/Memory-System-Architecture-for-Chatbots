agent_1: Yesterday I went grocery shopping and all the vegetables were on sale.
agent_2: Oh yeah? which one did you go to?
agent_1: The one next to the church.
agent_2: Do you know which vegetables are better now?
agent_1: It is tomato season, they have brought them very good.
agent_2: That's good, I'll buy some, too bad it's not melon season.
agent_1: The melon season starts in May.
agent_2: How come you know so much about vegetables?
agent_1: When I was a child I grew up in the country with my grandfather who had a garden.
agent_2: And you grew a lot of vegetables?
agent_1: A lot, my grandfather was a farmer, we cultivated all year round.
agent_2: What an envy, I grew up in the city and did not set foot in the countryside.
agent_1: What did your parents do?
agent_2: My parents were bankers and they did not like the countryside.
agent_1: A pity
agent_2: But when I buy a house I want it to have a yard to cultivate my own plants.
agent_1: Then ask me for help when you need it, I can advise you.
agent_2: Perfect! when I have my garden I'll let you know
agent_1: Great.
